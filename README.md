I have a screen shader enabled, hence the yellow tint to the website in the attached screenshots.

## Requirements / Purpose

### MVP

<br>

You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub

In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.

You are to use SCSS for styling.

You are to use B.E.M as a naming convention.

!!! Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good at all screen widths. VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops

Your Portfolio should have the following section:

A landing page/section with your name and title on it.

An About page/section with a little about you

A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course

A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)

A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link

## Design Goals / Approach

-   I wanted something sleek and neat looking for my first project
-   Minimalism isn't my go-to design choice, but for my first attempt I knew that I wasn't going to be able to pull off anything complicated
-   I initially had a more pink-purple tint to the whole page, leaning into a softer aesthetic, but eventually pulled it to the more modern and easily digestiable black and white pallette
-   I think that it is very plain, but was happy with the cohesion across the different pages here

## Future Goals

What are the immediate features you'd add given more time?
- My future goals with this project is to totally overhaul it, rebuilding it with React to really solidify my understanding of how React interacts with SCSS

## What did you struggle with?

-   This was my first project with _Nology, and so whilst I'd had a small amount of knowledge about HTML and CSS basics, this was my first fully fleshed out project in which I was trying to achieve an MVP
