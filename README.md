## Nology Portfolio Project

Placeholder first edition of the portfolio project.
Features a landing page/about me section, projects page and an informative page where I will list all my technical skills that would appeal to potential employers.

Will add to this to be more informative and offical of course.

You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub

In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.

You are to use SCSS for styling.

You are to use B.E.M as a naming convention.

!!! Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good at all screen widths. VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops

Your Portfolio should have the following section:

A landing page/section with your name and title on it.

An About page/section with a little about you

A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course

A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)

A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link

### TIPS:

Choose a clear,clean, simple colour palette

Make sure to have the MVP done with all the different section before adding extra feature (animations, effects, etc)

Create a new branch for each section of your page to practice your Git
